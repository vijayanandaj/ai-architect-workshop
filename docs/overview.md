# Program Overview

This 3-day workshop equips architects to combine **automation + GenAI** across the lifecycle:
- Day 1: get requirements right (extract, structure, validate, lint, NFR coverage)
- Day 2: produce and evolve architecture docs (HLD/ADRs) with AI assistance and risk checks
- Day 3: sustain governance (PR/CR evaluation vs ADRs, impact analysis, cloud specialization)

Participants leave with runnable scripts, prompts, and templates to embed into their projects.
