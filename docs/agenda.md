# 3-Day Agenda (Sessions)

**Day 1 — Getting Requirements Right (Sessions 1–6)**
- S1: AI-enhanced architect mindset; guardrails & pitfalls
- S2: Extracting & structuring requirements (Word/PDF → JSON/YAML)
- S3: Catching low-quality requirements early (lints, AC checks, duplicates)
- S4: Covering the non-functional “-ilities” with measurable targets
- S5: Traceability & ER/domain model generation (Mermaid)
- S6: Case Study 1 — clean, validated, reviewed requirements package

**Day 2 — Better Architecture Decisions & Lower Risk (Sessions 7–11)**
- S7: First-draft architecture doc, diagrams, and ADRs from validated inputs
- S8: Architecture evolution across PIs; delta analysis vs backlog; incremental ADRs
- S9: AI-assisted design exploration & trade-off stress tests
- S10: Migration & cost optimization plans with AI assistance
- S11: Case Study 2 — multi-constraint architecture package with ADR updates

**Day 3 — Maintenance, Governance & Cloud Specialization (Sessions 12–17)**
- S12: Evaluating CRs/PRs vs ADRs & architecture; divergence flags
- S13: Impact analysis (functional/NFR); risk summaries
- S14: Reconstructing outdated architecture from code/IaC/PR logs
- S15: Continuous compliance & living architecture docs
- S16: Cloud-specific governance (RTO/RPO, IaC scanning, “current cloud diagram”)
- S17: Case Study 3 — refreshed architecture package for audits & governance
